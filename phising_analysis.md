## Example 1: SupremeInvoice Fake Billing Email (`phishing1.png`)

### Indicators:
1. **Generic Sender Address**: `domain@domain-name.com` – clearly fake, no relation to an actual billing provider.
2. **Urgent Finance Request**: Shows a large invoice amount ($1,265.68) to pressure action.
3. **Suspicious Button**: “System Invoice Connect” likely redirects to a phishing page.
4. **No Contact Information**: No company details, phone, or verification methods.
5. **Odd Currency Format**: The use of `$` after the number is uncommon (should be `$1,265.68`).

## Example 2: Outlook Fake Account Upgrade (`phishing2.png`)

### Indicators:
1. **Generic Greeting**: “Dear User” instead of personalized name.
2. **Urgent Tone**: “Account services has expired” creates unnecessary panic.
3. **Spelling/Grammar**: “services has expired” (subject-verb disagreement).
4. **Fake Link**: Though it displays a real-looking link (`https://account.live.com`), could be masked.
5. **Sender Name Only**: No detailed signature, phone number, or verification badge.
